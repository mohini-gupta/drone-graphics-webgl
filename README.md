# Drone Simulation
A simulator of a drone that flies around a 3D landscape. The point of view is in a third person. The Drone doesn't fly underneath the terrain. That is the detection of the drone coming in contact with the terrain leads the drone to move upwards. 

Note: This was created as an assignment of Computer Graphics course in POLIMI.
